  <h2>Hello and welcome.</h2>

  <p>
    Chennai Elixir User Group is a community of Elixir enthusiasts in and around Chennai.
    We haven't conducted any meetups yet - still in the process of reaching out to interested folks to kickstart this group.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are currently in the process of creating a meetup page (will update this page once that process is complete),
    use <a href="https://elixir-chennai.slack.com">Slack</a> for chat,
    and have a <a href="http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/elixir-chennai">mailing list</a> - please feel free to join all these modes of communication.
